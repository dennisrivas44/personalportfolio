            <p>Welcome to the documentation page for our basic responsive web page project. This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to creating a simple yet effective web page that adapts to various screen sizes. By following this walkthrough, you will learn the essential principles of responsive design and how to implement them using HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>Responsive design is crucial in today's web development landscape, where users access websites from a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. A responsive web page ensures a consistent and user-friendly experience across all these devices. This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to build such a page from scratch.</p>

            <header>Project Setup</header>
            <p>To start, create a project folder and set up the necessary files. This will include an HTML file for the structure of the web page and a CSS file for the styles. Organizing your files properly from the beginning will help you manage your project more efficiently.</p>
            <h3>Some example code to get you started:</h3>
            <code>&lt;h1>Main Heading&lt;/h1><br>
                  &lt;p>This is a paragraph of text.&lt;/p></code>
          </section>

            <header>Creating HTML Structure</header>
            <p>In this section, we will create the HTML structure of the web page. This includes setting up the basic elements such as the header, navigation, main content sections, and footer.</p>
    
            <ol class="steps"><h3>Steps:</h3>
              <li>Create a Basic HTML Template: Start by setting up a basic HTML template that includes the necessary doctype, HTML, head, and body tags.</li>
              <li>Add a Header: Include a header section that contains the title of your web page and a navigation menu with links to different sections of the page.</li>
              <li>Create Main Content Sections: Divide the main content into sections such as "Home," "About," and "Contact." Each section should have a heading and some placeholder text.</li>
              <li>Add a Footer: At the bottom of the page, include a footer with some basic information like copyright text.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Customize your website by adding an image!</h3>
            <code>&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image"></code>
            <p><h3>Customize your website by adding a link!</h3>
              <code>use &lt;a> to add a link</code>

            <header>Adding CSS for Styling</header>
            <p>Now, we will add CSS to style the web page. This involves setting colors, fonts, and layout styles to make your web page visually appealing and user-friendly.</p>
            <p>
              <ol class="Steps">
                <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <li>Define Basic Styles for the Body: Set the default font family, background color, and margins for the body element.</li>
                <li>Style the Header and Navigation: Apply styles to the header, including background color, font size, and padding. Style the navigation links to make them look interactive and attractive.</li>
                <li>Apply Styles to Main Content Sections: Set styles for the main content sections, such as background colors, margins, padding, and font sizes to ensure they are distinct and readable.</li>
                <li>Style the Footer: Apply styles to the footer to match the overall design of the page, including background color, text alignment, and padding.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>To apply some basic styling to images:</h3>
            <code>img {<br>
                <div class="indent">max-width: 100%;<br>
                height: auto;<br>
                display: block;<br>
                margin: 0 auto;}</div></code>
